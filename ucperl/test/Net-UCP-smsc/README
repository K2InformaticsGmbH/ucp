*** DESCRIPTION

This is a test SMSC and a test client, a.k.a. esme.

To start the smsc write ./smsc.pl

The smsc listens to port 5000 on the local machine.

You  can make  multiple  connections to  it  and it  reads and  parses
incoming UCP messages. If the mesage is 31, 51 or 60 it replies with a
dummy ACK. If it is something else it replies with a NACK/unsupported.

The smsc also writes cryptic messages.

The esme connects and sends a message and disconnect.  It is of course
started with ./esme.pl.


*** DEPRECATED

Using this SMSC  in the UCPERL project is more  or less deprecated, as
there now is an Erlang SMSC also.  It can be nice to use it for sanity
tests  -  so  that  you   jnow  that  something  outside  the  project
understands what you send.


*** BUG

There  is currently  a bug  in  the Net::UCP  library so  it does  not
recognise the  31 message. The bug  is reported.  But ...  if you dont
want a NACK for 31 then you have to fix it manually.

In the file /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.0/Net/UCP.pm you have
to change the line ...

    if (my($optype) = $resp =~ m{^\d{2}/\d{5}/.*?/(01|02|03|30|51|52|53|54|55|56|57|58|60|61)/.*}) {

... to ...

    if (my($optype) = $resp =~ m{^\d{2}/\d{5}/.*?/(01|02|03|30|31|51|52|53|54|55|56|57|58|60|61)/.*}) {

... i.e. adding 31
